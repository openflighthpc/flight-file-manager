#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Supervisor Port
# The port the supervisor process will be launched on
# The environment variable FLIGHT_FILE_MANAGER_PORT takes precedence
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# port: 920

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PID File Path
# The path to where the PID of the supervisor process should be stored
# The environment variable FLIGHT_FILE_MANAGER_PIDFILE takes precedence
#
# The default is relative to the install directory. All overrides should use
# absolute paths. The behaviour of overrides with relative paths is undefined.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# pidfile: /path/to/flight-file-manager/var/puma.pid

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pam Authentication Service
# Specify the pam service which will be used to authenticate the requests.
# The environment variable FLIGHT_FILE_MANAGER_PAM_SERVICE
#
# CAUTION: All authenticated requests must correspond with a linux user. Failure
#          to do so will cause the cloudcmd process to fail. This should be the
#          case for any pam service which uses 'pam_unix.so'.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# pam_service: sshd

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cloudcmd Command
# Specify the command that will launch the cloudcmd service. The command
# support must write the port it started on to file descriptor 3. Failure to
# write the port will prevent users from connecting to the service. The port
# must not contain non-integer characters including newline.
#
# There is a special '$config_path' variable which should be included in the
# command. This will be substituted for the pre-generated cloudcmd config path
# containing the username/password.
#
# The $config_path is the pre-generated cloudcmd config for the particular
# user and contains the username/password.
#
# For security reasons, the command is not executed via a subshell. This means
# all other string interplation/ variables have been disabled. Each argument is
# interpreted as a literal string and should not be quoted.

# cloudcmd_command: /path/to/flight-file-manager/libexec/cloudcmd.sh $config_path $port_path

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cache Directory
# Specify the directory that internal runtime data
# The environment variable FLIGHT_FILE_MANAGER_CACHE_DIR takes precedence
#
# The default is relative to the install directory. All overrides should use
# absolute paths. The behaviour of overrides with relative paths is undefined.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# cache_dir: /path/to/flight-file-manager/var/cache

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Log Directory
# Specify the directory log files are stored within
# The environment variable FLIGHT_FILE_MANAGER_LOG_DIR takes precedence
#
# The default is relative to the install directory. All overrides should use
# absolute paths. The behaviour of overrides with relative paths is undefined.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# log_dir: /path/to/flight_file_manager/var/log

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Log Level
# Specify the logging level
# Valid levels are: fatal, error, warn, info, debug
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# log_level: info
